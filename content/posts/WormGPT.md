# Executive Summary

In the vast realm of technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) stands as a powerful force, revolutionizing industries and reshaping the way we interact with the digital world. With its ability to learn, adapt, and perform tasks autonomously, AI has become an integral part of our daily lives, from virtual personal assistants to recommendation algorithms that guide our online experiences. Yet, as we embrace the marvels of this cutting-edge technology, a darker underbelly emerges, where AI is not just a tool for progress but a weapon for malicious intent.

In the realm of AI chatbots, familiar faces like Siri, Google Assistant and Alexa have become household names, offering assistance and companionship. However, amidst the bright facade of helpful virtual assistants, there exists a shadowy counterpart – a breed of AI designed not to serve, but to exploit. 

During this blog post, we will delve into the unnerving world of dark AI, exploring the ominous applications that threaten to misuse the very technology designed to make our lives easier.


# WormGPT

WormGPT is a chatbot developed by LastMalware. It is based on the GPT-J language model from 2021, which is an open-source large language model capable of generating text similar to humans, similar to ChatGPT. Being open-source, unlike OpenAI, the laboratory behind ChatGPT, means that anyone can inspect, share, and even modify the source code. This, combined with the absence of anti-abuse restrictions that prevent ChatGPT from using profanity, writing hate speech, or viruses, means that WormGPT can fulfill any kind of malicious requests.

The tool was initially offered at a price of 100€ (approximately 110.64 USD) per month or 550€ (around 649USD) per year. This accessible cost was meticulously aligned with the user's intent, unlocking features, including support for unlimited characters, chat memory retention, and code formatting capabilities. Its proficiency in writing and formatting code is particularly noteworthy, providing the capability to construct sophisticated malware attacks.

**LastMalware**, also known as **sim-4932765** and **last**, became a member of an underground forum on January 23, 2021, with a primary focus on enhancing his knowledge of malware development through interactions with other forum members. Despite being labeled as a malware developer/seller, he attempted to obscure his nationality by claiming to be from Poland.

In his quest for involvement, **LastMalware** sought membership in various hacking groups like **Coined**, **Mafia Crew**, and **PinkLSZ Developers**.
